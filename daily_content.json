This system is often called \u2018fractional reserve banking.\u2019 When you deposit $100 into a bank, the bank is only required to keep a fraction (the reserve) of that money physically stored. The rest is free for them to lend out."

        "text": "When a bank approves a loan for a new car or business venture, they don\u2019t actually move existing money from the vault to the borrower\u2019s account. Instead, they simply type a number into the digital ledger, creating a brand new deposit entry. The money that the borrower now has in their account\u2014which they can spend\u2014did not exist an instant before the loan was approved. It is created as debt, backed only by the promise of future repayment."

That second bank, in turn, keeps only a fraction and loans out the rest, creating even more new deposits. This ripple effect of lending and depositing is how the money supply expands far beyond the initial physical cash printed by the government, turning commercial banks into the primary engine of modern money creation."

Wouldn't they split the existing customers and make less money? This phenomenon, common in everything from car dealerships and high-fashion districts to Silicon Valley, is explained by the power of \"customer search costs\" and market specialization. The immediate proximity actually benefits all parties involved."

        "text": "The main benefit is to the customer. If someone is looking to purchase a specific or high-value item\u2014like a wedding dress, a new mattress, or a luxury watch\u2014they need to compare options, prices, and quality before committing. If all the retailers are clustered together, the customer saves enormous amounts of time and effort, knowing they can browse the entire market within a few blocks. The cluster becomes a magnet, drawing consumers specifically looking for that product category from far wider geographical areas."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Furthermore, these clusters benefit from shared infrastructure and expertise. In tech hubs like Silicon Valley, talent, suppliers, specialized investors, and knowledge flow easily between the clustered companies. For retail, the density creates high foot traffic and builds a reputation\u2014the area becomes known as \"the place to go for X.\" While local competition is intense, the increased total volume of customers brought in by the collective reputation usually outweighs the sales lost to the neighbor."

This is because, initially, the returns we earn are based only on the small starting amount, known as the principal. This is the stage of linear growth, where progress is steady but unremarkable. However, money doesn\u2019t grow linearly; it grows exponentially, and the mathematics of compounding is the reason why wealth creation looks like a drawn-out climb followed by a sudden vertical take-off."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "The concept of compounding means that you earn a return not just on your initial investment, but also on the returns you earned last year. It\u2019s often explained using the \"snowball effect.\" When the snowball is tiny, it only picks up a tiny amount of new snow as it rolls. But as it rolls and grows, the surface area becomes massive, and it begins picking up enormous amounts of snow with every rotation, growing faster and faster over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "In finance, the principal (the core investment) gets larger and larger because the returns are being reinvested. This means your returns start generating their own returns. The most crucial takeaway is that the biggest gains don't occur in the early years; they happen right near the end of the investment horizon, because that is when the base amount is the largest. Time, therefore, is the most valuable asset for anyone hoping to harness the powerful and dramatic effects of exponential growth."
