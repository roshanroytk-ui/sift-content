Before a product exists, only knowledge does. This knowledge is our most valuable resource because, unlike a piece of fruit, when you share an idea, you still have it. When someone figures out a better way to do something, whether it\u2019s growing food more efficiently or finding a faster way to send an email, they have just made the whole system slightly richer. This \"better way\" is the fundamental engine of progress, proving that true wealth is not the gold in the ground, but the innovations in the human mind."

Finance is simply the art of moving future potential into the present; an investor takes a risk on the inventor, providing the necessary funds (capital) to build the factory or hire the team. The primary incentive for this risk is profit\u2014the promise that if they successfully solve a problem for enough people, they will earn back more than they put in. This cycle of risk, investment, and reward ensures that the best solutions don't stay locked up in labs, but are quickly manufactured and pushed out to the masses."

This process is called \"efficiency,\" and it is technology's biggest gift to economics. Think of a computer today versus one fifty years ago. Today\u2019s technology is vastly more powerful, yet costs a fraction of the price. Competition drives businesses to constantly find cheaper, faster, and better ways to produce things. This relentless technological improvement is why the basics of modern life\u2014communication, information, and even manufactured goods\u2014become cheaper and more accessible over time, constantly lifting the global standard of living for billions of people worldwide."
