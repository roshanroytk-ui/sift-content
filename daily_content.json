Your phone is actually a sophisticated \"listener.\" High above the Earth, a fleet of satellites is constantly shouting out two pieces of information: exactly what time it is and exactly where the satellite is located. Your phone picks up these signals from several satellites at once and compares the tiny differences in when each message arrived to calculate your position."

        "text": "The most fascinating part of this technology involves the way time itself behaves. Because these satellites are moving very fast and are far away from Earth's gravity, time actually moves a tiny bit faster for them than it does for us on the ground. If scientists didn't use Albert Einstein\u2019s theories to nudge the satellite clocks back by a few billionths of a second every day, the GPS on your phone would be off by several miles within twenty-four hours. Your map works only because we account for the fact that time is not the same everywhere."

It doesn't just help you find a coffee shop; it coordinates the timing of global banking transactions, helps airplanes land safely in the dark, and allows shipping companies to track goods across the ocean. Every time you see that little blue dot on your screen, you are witnessing a perfect harmony between high-level physics and everyday convenience."
