        "text": "Before the 1950s, sending goods across the ocean was a slow and messy puzzle. Groups of workers had to carry individual sacks of flour, barrels of oil, and wooden crates of fruit onto ships by hand. It was like trying to pack a giant suitcase using thousands of tiny, different-sized pebbles. Because it took so long and required so much manual labor, the cost of moving things was incredibly high, making imported goods an expensive luxury for most people."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Everything changed when an American truck driver had a simple idea: stop moving the goods and start moving the boxes. He helped develop the standardized shipping container\u2014the large metal rectangles you see on ships and trains today. Because every box was the exact same size, engineers could build massive cranes and ships specifically designed to stack them perfectly. This meant a ship that used to take weeks to load could now be packed in just a few hours with mechanical precision."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "This \"box\" effectively shrank the planet. The cost of shipping plummeted so low that it became cheaper to grow a piece of fruit or sew a shirt on the other side of the world than to produce it in your own neighborhood. This tiny change in how we move things is the reason your computer, your clothes, and your favorite snacks are affordable and available at a store nearby. It turned the entire Earth into one giant, interconnected marketplace."
