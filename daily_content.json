If a company wanted to send shoes or flour to another country, workers had to carry individual sacks, wooden crates, and barrels onto a ship one by one. This process took days or even weeks, and because it was so labor-intensive, the cost of shipping was often higher than the cost of making the actual product. Because of this, most people only bought things that were made in their own local towns."

        "text": "Everything changed when an American trucker named Malcom McLean realized that instead of loading thousands of small items, we should just load one giant, standardized steel box. This \"shipping container\" allowed cranes to move massive amounts of goods in seconds. Suddenly, ships didn't have to sit in ports for weeks; they could arrive, unload, and leave in a single day. The cost of moving a television across the world dropped from a small fortune to just a few dollars."

        "text": "This drop in price is the reason why your coffee comes from South America, your phone is designed in California, and your clothes are made in Asia. Because shipping became so cheap and reliable, companies stopped building factories near their customers and started building them wherever it was most efficient. These plain metal boxes are the invisible backbone of the modern economy, turning the entire planet into one giant, interconnected marketplace where almost any product is just a boat ride away."
