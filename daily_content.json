This price covers tangible things: the raw materials, the labor, the electricity used to power the factory, and the profit margin for the company. We rely on the market to efficiently package all these costs together. However, a major failure point in market economics is that certain vital resources\u2014like clean air, fresh water, and environmental health\u2014are treated as free, resulting in fundamentally deceptive prices."

If that manufacturer saves money by dumping chemical runoff into a nearby river instead of paying for expensive disposal and treatment, the cost of the finished product remains artificially low. The factory owner gets the benefit of cost savings, but the surrounding community or the public health system ends up paying the actual price\u2014the fouled drinking water, the cleanup effort, and the subsequent health burden. This is a real economic cost, but because the market sends no bill for clean water, that expense is simply shifted to an uninvolved third party."

When the ability to pollute is free, pollution becomes rampant. The only way to correct this profound market failure and align the price tag with the true planetary burden is through regulation or pricing mechanisms. By introducing things like carbon taxes or strict environmental limits, societies force producers to finally \"internalize\" those expenses\u2014meaning they must pay the cost of the cleanup\u2014so that the price on the shelf reflects the full and honest burden placed upon the world."
