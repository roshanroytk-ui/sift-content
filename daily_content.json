        "text": "Imagine you are the only person in the world with a telephone. It would be completely useless because you have no one to call. But the moment a second person gets one, the phone suddenly has value. As more people join the network, the value of having a phone doesn\u2019t just grow a little bit; it explodes. This is because every new person who joins creates a new connection for everyone who was already there. In the world of business and technology, we call this the \"network effect,\" and it is the secret engine behind almost every giant company you use today."

        "text": "This effect creates a powerful cycle that is very hard to stop. Think about why you use a specific social media app or a messaging tool. It usually isn\u2019t because that app has the best buttons or the prettiest colors. You use it because that is where all your friends, family, and coworkers are. If you switched to a brand-new app that was technically better, you would be back to being the person with the only telephone in the world. The true value of the service isn\u2019t in the software itself, but in the massive web of people already connected to it."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Because of this rule, winning in business is often more about being first or growing the fastest rather than having the most expensive features. Once a company reaches a certain size, it becomes a \"natural winner\" where it is much easier for a new person to join the crowd than to try something new. This explains why it is so difficult for small startups to challenge the giants of the internet. It isn\u2019t just about money or fancy technology; it\u2019s about the fact that a product becomes more useful simply because everyone else is already there."
