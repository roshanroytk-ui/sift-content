        "text": "Imagine a giant invisible game where everyone is trying to win a prize. In the world of economics, these prizes are called incentives. An incentive is simply a reason to do something, like a bonus at work for doing a good job or a discount at the grocery store for buying extra fruit. Whether we realize it or not, most of the things we see around us\u2014from the way buildings are constructed to the speed of your internet\u2014happen because someone, somewhere, was given a reward to make it happen."

        "text": "Business and technology are built entirely on this idea. A company creates a faster smartphone not just because they like gadgets, but because they know people will pay more for better tools. This creates a cycle where the desire for a reward leads to better inventions for everyone else. When the rewards are set up correctly, people work hard and innovate because their personal success is tied to solving a problem for others. It turns individual goals into a benefit for the whole community."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "However, the trickiest part of making the world work is setting the right rules. Sometimes, a reward can lead to the wrong behavior if the goal isn't clear. For example, if a city pays people to pick up trash based on how many bags they fill, someone might start using tiny bags just to get paid more. This is why leaders and scientists spend so much time studying how people react to rules. By understanding these invisible strings, we can better understand why the world looks the way it does and how we can change it for the better."
