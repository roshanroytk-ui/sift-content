        "text": "For thousands of years, economics revolved around scarcity. The most valuable things\u2014gold, oil, farmland, physical factories\u2014were \"rivalrous.\" If one person was using a specific piece of land, another person could not. This hard constraint meant that economic growth was mostly linear; you got richer by finding more stuff or working harder. Traditional business was defined by the cost of turning raw materials into finished goods and transporting them across physical space. If the world suddenly ran out of ideas, we could still technically keep working, but we would never get any better at it, and growth would quickly stall."

        "text": "The dramatic acceleration of wealth over the last two centuries is the result of a revolutionary realization: the most valuable asset isn't a physical object, but a perfect instruction set\u2014an idea, a chemical formula, a line of software code. Unlike a barrel of oil, an instruction set is \"non-rivalrous.\" When a software engineer writes a program that automates a task, that program can be copied and used by a billion people instantly, without diminishing the original. The value is contained entirely in the knowledge, not the raw materials. This shift means the limiting factor in human productivity is no longer physical scarcity, but the speed at which we can generate new, useful information."

        "text": "This is the true engine of modern finance and business. Every new idea or scientific breakthrough acts as a stepping stone for the next. The work done by a physicist in 1960 enabled the creation of the internet protocol, which in turn enabled the explosion of apps and global business platforms today. Knowledge doesn't simply accumulate; it compounds exponentially. A business that leverages software can suddenly serve a global market at a fraction of the cost of a traditional physical company. This compounding knowledge is why the world can continue to improve its standard of living while simultaneously using less energy and material per unit of output\u2014because we aren't just working harder, we are working with smarter instructions."
