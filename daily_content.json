        "text": "Before the middle of the last century, loading a cargo ship was a slow and messy puzzle. Thousands of workers had to carry individual sacks of flour, barrels of oil, and wooden crates of clothes onto a deck by hand. Because every item was a different size and shape, it took days or even weeks to fill a single vessel. This meant that shipping things across the ocean was incredibly expensive, so most people primarily bought goods that were produced in their own nearby towns."

        "text": "Everything changed when a businessman realized that we shouldn't be moving items, but rather moving the space they sit in. By making every shipping container the exact same size, engineers were able to design ships, cranes, and trucks that fit them perfectly, like giant Lego pieces. This meant a ship could be loaded in a few hours instead of many days. Suddenly, the cost of moving a product across the world dropped so low that the distance between the maker and the buyer almost didn't matter anymore."

        "text": "This simple invention is the reason your smartphone, your coffee, and your shoes can come from three different continents and still be affordable. Because shipping became so cheap and reliable, companies stopped building factories near their customers and started building them wherever they could work most efficiently. Our modern world is held together by millions of these steel boxes traveling silently across the sea, making the entire planet function like one giant, connected marketplace."
